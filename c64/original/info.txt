		assembler listing (missing parts)

Errata and hints:
	c't Magazine 1984/12 p. 9
		Basic OPEN command is not supported
		(device 7 used for SuperTape, leads
		to ?DEVICE NOT PRESENT ERROR)
		Heise noted that an extension is
		in preparation.
	c't Magazine 1984/12 p. 10
	c't Magazine 1985/2 p. 11
		Usage with EXBASIC Level II: 
			1. Leave EXBASIC with command "BASIC"
			2. Do SuperTape LOAD/SAVE
			3. Re-enter EXBASIC with ?USR(0)
	c't Magazine 1985/4 p. 10
		ROM-based SuperTape can be used with
		project "EPROM-Bank für den C64", but
		the loader part has to be re-assembled
		into another address range. Heise
		announce a suitable variant to be added
		to their software service.
